# Documentation

To start documenting locally, you'll need to have a Python 3.7 version or higher installed.

Then, install all docs requirements with the following command line:

```bash
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

To start the local docs server, simply run:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

and you are ready to go!
